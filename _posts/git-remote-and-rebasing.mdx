  ## Adding a git remote and rebasing your local branch

  You may often want to work from a fork of another repository and then merge a branch on your fork into that repository. Understanding how synchronize your fork's branch locally with that repository is very helpful.

  This will show you how to create a local git remote and rebase your local branch with a remote branch.

  Rebasing a branch in git means to reapply commits from another branch on top of your local branch. Rebasing is a useful way to update your fork's branch locally if the repostory that it is based on has changed.

  ## Adding a git remote

  Git can be used to add a remote branch. Assuming you already have git initialized, you can get started:

  ```bash
  git remote add [remoteName] https://github.com/[username]/[repository].git
  ```

  For example:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/myusername/sample.git
  ```

  <div style={{ marginTop: '60px' }} />

  ## Rebasing local branch with remote

  Fetch updates from the remote branch and rebase the your local branch with the remote

  ```bash
  git fetch [remoteName]
  git rebase [remoteName]/[branchName]
  ```

  For example,
  ```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```

  <div style={{ marginTop: '40px' }} />

  If there is a merge conflict, you will probably want to resolve it.

  Below are some commands that can be used during a merge conflict.

  <div style={{ marginTop: '40px' }} />

  * Continue - When the conflict has been resolved, this will finish the rebase.
    ```bash
    git rebase --continue
    ```

  * Abort - stops the rebase and checks out the original branch
    ```bash
    git rebase --abort
    ```

  * Skip - skips the rebase of the commit that has caused the merge conflict. None of the changes in that commit will be applied.
    ```bash
    git rebase --skip
    ```

    Once you have completed the rebase, your checked out branch is now be in sync with remoteName.
