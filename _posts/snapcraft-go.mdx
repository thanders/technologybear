  ## Why is this useful for web development?

  Memoization can be useful for web application development because webpages often depend on functions calls to be complete before completing the render of a page. If a function is expensive and gets called many times, often returning the same result, memoization may be able to help.

  ## React Development


  ### The React useMemo hook

  ReactJS provides a hook for memoization, <ExternalLink postID='memoization' linkID='useMemo' />. Memoization for react webapps can be very useful, but there are a few important things to remember:
  - The function passed to useMemo will always run during rendering. Don’t do anything there that you wouldn’t normally do while rendering.
  - Write your code so that it still works without useMemo — and implement memoization, if needed, to optimize performance.
  - Profile the related component to ensure that memoization improves performance


  ### Example

  The example below shows how to memoize an example function.
  ```
  sudo snap install dealership-service_*.snap --devmode --dangerous
  sudo snap remove woke
  ```

Use the snapcraft CLI to login to your Snapcraft account
```
  snapcraft login
```
Upload the snap file to your account. The command below includes the release definition(edge, stable, )
```
  snapcraft upload --release=edge dealership-service_*.snap
```

```
  snapcraft --debug
  snapcraft push dealership-service_0.2_amd64.snap
  systemctl list-units --type=service
  journalctl -u snap.dealership-service.dealership-service.service
  systemctl reset-failed
  ```

  ```
  multipass list
  multipass delete --purge snapcraft-instance-name
  ```
