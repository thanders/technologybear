  ## What is Redux?

  Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

  Redux allows global state of your webapp to be stored in an object tree within a single store.

  Redux follows a flux like design pattern.

  ## Can Redux be used with React and NextJS?

  Yes, Redux can be used as a data store for any UI layer. The most common usage is with React and React Native, but there are bindings available for Angular, Angular 2, Vue, Mithril, and more.

  ## Data Flow

  Redux follows a unidirectional data flow.

  ### Related terminology

  Store - is a read-only object which holds the state of the application

  Actions - are objects that describe events, example `{type: 'deposit', payload: 10}`

  Reducers - are functions that implement action behavior to the current state and return the new state

  Dispatch - is the store's method for passing actions into reducers to update the store's state

  ## What is Redux Toolkit?

  The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.

  <b>Redux Toolkit</b> was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

  - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
  - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
  - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

  <b>Redux Toolkit</b> is written in TypeScript, and its API is designed to enable great integration with TypeScript applications.

  ## What are some of the benefits of using Redux?

  - A centralized global state management system
  - Simple debugging And testing
  - Redux Dev Tools - great for debugging state changes
  - Predictable Results
    - The store is a read only single source of truth
    - Reducers are pure functions (a given input will always equal the same output)

  ## When should I use Redux for my React App?

  Redux is a good solution for features that will benefit from global state.
  
  Global state is useful for features that need to switch between components and routes. For example:
  - Form inputs (account creation, shopping cart, checkout)
  - Form validation
  - Account information for a logged in user

  However, not every feature will require global state. Certain features can use stateless components or components with local state.

  ## How can I write unit tests for Redux Tookit?

  Unit and integration tests can be done using standard frameworks, such as jest and the react-testing-library.
